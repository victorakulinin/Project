# Project description

I'm an analyst at a big online store. Together with the marketing department, I've compiled a list of hypotheses that may help boost revenue. I must prioritize these hypotheses, launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.

## I have:
- nine hypotheses on boosting an online store's
- file with orders
- file with the number of visits divided into group

## I'm going to do the following:
- prioritizing hypotheses using ICE and RICE frameworks
- studying cumulative revenue, average order size, and the relative difference in cumulative average order size for groups
- studying conversion rate
- studying anomalies
- find the statistical significance of the difference in conversion between the groups
- find the statistical significance of the difference in average order size between the groups
- find the statistical significance of the difference in conversion between the groups without anomalies
- find the statistical significance of the difference in average order size between the groups without anomalies
- make conclusion
