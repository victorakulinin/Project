# Project description

I work at a startup that sells food products. Now I need to investigate user behavior for the company's app.

In the first stage, I study the sales funnel. I find out how users reach the purchase stage. How many users make it to this stage? How many get stuck at previous stages? Which stages in particular?

Then, I look at the results of an A/A/B test.
The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test.
The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. I need to find out which set of fonts produces better results.
