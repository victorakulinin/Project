# Video Trends Dashboard

I work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. My devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.  

Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date. 

A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.

Every week, the new employees Melanie and Ashok ask me the same questions:

- What video categories were trending last week?
- How were they distributed among various regions?
- What categories were especially popular in the United States?

In my sixth week on the job, I decide that it's high time the process were automated. I'm going to make a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok.
