# Data Preprocessing
My task is to prepare a report for the bank's credit department. I need to find out if the client's marital status and the number of children affect the non-payment of the loan.
I was lucky, I donâ€™t need to collect data myself, the bank provided some data on the creditworthiness of customers collected by its employees.

# My project will include the following steps:
- analysis of gaps and duplicates.
- deciding which incorrect lines to keep and which can be deleted.
- filling in the value in the missing cells of the table.
- remove duplicates.
- creation of categories to simplify the testing of hypotheses.
- draw conclusions for each hypothesis.
- general conclusion.

# Main Python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
