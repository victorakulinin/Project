# Integrated project
I work for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. My job is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow me to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns.
In front of me is data going back to 2016. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.

# My project will include the following steps:
- Opening the data file and studying the general information. Working with missing data, duplicated, and wrong data types, and enriching the data.
- Analyzing which and how many games were released in different years.
- Analyzing sales on different platforms.
- Determining what period and set of data is relevant for prognosis.
- Researching how user and professional reviews affect sales. Taking a look at the correlation between reviews and sales.
- Game genre research, looking for high and low genre sales.
- Creating a user profile for each region, and looking for top platforms and top profitable genres.
- Testing the following hypotheses:
  - Average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.
  - Average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
- Making the final conclusion.
