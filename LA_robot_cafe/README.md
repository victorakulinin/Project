# Telling a story using data
I’ve decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so my partners and I decided to try attracting investors. They’re interested in the current market conditions—will I be able to maintain my success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off?
I’m an analytics guru, so my partners have asked me to prepare some market research. I have open-source data on restaurants in LA.
