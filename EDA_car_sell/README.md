# EDA Project: What sells a car?
In the project, I have three main objects to study: cars, their price, and advertisements for their sale.
First, I'm going to look at the basic parameters of cars: price, vehicle's age when the ad was placed, mileage, number of cylinders, and condition.
Then I'll take a closer look at the ads, study "the duration of their life", and check the most popular ones.
After that, I will move on to the price and study what characteristics and how they can influence it.

# Main Python libraries used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statistics
